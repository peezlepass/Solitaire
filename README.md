# Welcome to a Solitaire game!

## Installation



You actually don't have to install anything! Just visit the deployed version <a href="https://peezlepass.com/solitaire/">here</a>.

## How to Play (I hope you know the rules!)

<li>Click on a tile to reveal what is underneath it. If it is a bomb, the game is over. To restart - click on the emoji.</li>

</p>
<li>If the tile is not a bomb, it will display a number indicating how many bombs are adjacent to it.</li>
<li>Use this information to deduce the location of bombs and mark them with a flag by right-clicking on the tile.</li>
